Achoo ia a preventative care app that focuses on the general public’s inability to distinguish between the common cold and flu, and this mishap can lead to severe consequences. From 2017-2018, approximately 80,000 people died from the flu and 180 were children. This app helps users know when it’s time to see a doctor to determine whether or not they have a cold or flu. 

## Getting Started
Once users answer a series of questions, they will get a result that states whether or not they have the flu or the cold. Each result will provide them with information such as home remedies and exercises they can do to stay healthy.
